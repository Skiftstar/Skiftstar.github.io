Although I didn't delve deeply into mod development, I started creating plugins for Minecraft servers, which was the reason for teaching myself Java.\n\nOver the years, I have expanded my expertise to include multiple programming languages. You can explore my complete skill set on the next page.",

	"Hitori Bot Description": "This is my personal Discord bot, developed entirely in TypeScript with DiscordJS and a web interface using React and Tailwind. I add commands as needed, so the bot can seem a bit messy, but it's tailored to my requirements.\n\nCurrently, the bot can archive Discord servers to a local SQLite file (including media) and offers a web interface for viewing and searching archives, enhancing server longevity.\n\nI plan to add more commands in the future, and I welcome suggestions.",
