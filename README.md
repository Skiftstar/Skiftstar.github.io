My Personal Portfolio Website

All Components are entirely writting by me, with only the bouncy arrows (like the one above) being from Material Icons, as well the Fonts 'Lato' (for texts like this one) and 'Exo 2' (for headers) from Google Fonts.

I wanted to make this whole Website in Plain HTML/CSS/JS at first, but after I made the first page I decided that not using React when I have the ability to do so would just be a giant waste of my time lol
