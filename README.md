My Personal Portfolio Website

# What's so cool about this?
Well, I made it, that's the first thing, some highlights tho are:
- The smooth animations (especially the scroll animation, I love it so much)
- The large amount of screen sizes that are supported (I spent hours dragging my browser around to different sizes lol)
- I guess the seperate mobile layout, even if it's not as fancy as the desktop variant.
- The Projects and Skills are loaded dynamically (Projects from [here](https://github.com/Skiftstar/Skiftstar.github.io/blob/main/src/data/project-metadata.json) and Skills from [here](https://github.com/Skiftstar/Skiftstar.github.io/blob/main/src/data/skills-metadata.json), meaning that I don't have to go into Code to add more of those, I can just put in the png and add an entry to the JSON file.
- i18n Support (tho that's simple thanks to the i18n package)

# Prebuilt Components?
All Components are entirely writting by me, with only the bouncy arrows (like the one above) being from Material Icons, as well the Fonts 'Lato' (for texts like this one) and 'Exo 2' (for headers) from Google Fonts.

# Why React?
I wanted to make this whole Website in Plain HTML/CSS/JS at first, but after I made the first page I decided that not using React when I have the ability to do so would just be a giant waste of my time lol
